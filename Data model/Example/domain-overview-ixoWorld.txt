IXO

IXO builds the Internet of Impacts: a Spatial Web platform and Layer-1 blockchain that uses verifiable claims, digital twins, and agentic oracles to coordinate and finance real-world outcomes. It serves governments, enterprises, DAOs, and developers running outcome-based programs across climate, health, and youth domains. The aim is dependable, auditable impact at internet scale.

As Owner, your leverage comes from governance and delivery cadence. Prioritize domain policy, authorization, and upgrade decisions, then unblock deployments where verifiable data and automated payments compound value. Focus on dMRV programs and agent onboarding where assurance and interoperability are non-negotiable. Keep the feedback loop tight between domain rooms, on-chain state, and service endpoints to maintain accountability.
