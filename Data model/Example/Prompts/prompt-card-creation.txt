You are an expert in linked data, ontologies, and IXO domain structures.  
Your task is to populate the following JSON-LD DomainCard template for a specific organisation.  
Use authoritative and verifiable information to replace each <<<Placeholder>>>.  
Follow IXO, schema.org, and Project Ontology conventions precisely.  
Maintain all contextual fields, @types, and property structures.  
Return valid JSON-LD, properly indented and machine-readable.  

---

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Replace every <<<Placeholder>>> with accurate, current information about the organisation provided below.
2. Keep every field description intact if no real data is available.
3. If some fields are unknown, insert a placeholder value (e.g. "TBD") but keep the correct structure.
4. Add additional schema-compliant objects (e.g. extra `schema:hasPart`, `schema:citation`, or `proj:hasActivity` entries) if relevant.
5. Preserve the existing @context, vocabularies, and proof section structure.
6. Verify that all URLs are syntactically valid and correspond to real or plausible domains.
7. Return only the completed JSON-LD object — no explanatory text outside the code block.
